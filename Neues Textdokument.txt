a)  The defining property of Gaussian noise is to create digital noise having the probability density function, 
    which is normally distributed and thus it is good for testing algorithms because of the Central Limit Theorem states
    that normally distributed signals are common in nature and this is also shown in the resulting probability density
    function which becomes a Gaussian.

b)  A low-pass filter lets all frequencies under the adjusted frequency pass. For all frequencies above, their 
    amplitude is reduced or damped. 

c)  A moving average filter is a low-pass filter. Because it takes the average of a specific amount of input signals
    to create a signal point and therefore removing the high-frequency components from it.
